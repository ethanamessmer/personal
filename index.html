            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Software engineering student</p>
            <p>I am a current student at Iowa state unniversity studying 
                software engineering and am currently in my third year 
                of schooling. I am currently learning more about web 
                development, video game design, and big data analysis. </p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>

                    progress)</h4>
                <p>The project that I am working on in my spare time is a video game
                    called "GhostShift". I am making it in the C# based game engine 
                    Unity&trade;. The game is about a ghost bartender who must take 
                    clues and quests from his patrons in order to solve a string of
                    mysteries that build off of each other. This, so far, has been 
                    an extremely fulfilling project embracing both the creative elements
                     of game design and the logical output of programming.
